# CoverletterGenerator

# This project can be used to generate a cover letter tailor made for you based on your cv (which you have to upload), your dream job title/description, and your dream company. The python library, PyMuPDF (imported # using legacy name fitz) parses the uploaded pdf and then the ai model used generates a cover letter suitable to the user.
